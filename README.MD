<h1 align="center">Snake</h1>

I was tasked to create a Snake Game in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day twenty-one of the class.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-OOP and more in depth class creation.

-On key stroke listening.

-Using methods to properly animate movement.

-Slicing lists.

<h2>What I learned</h2>
This was a great project to practice OOP and some newer fundamentals. Having methods "talk" to other methods and keeping track of various attributes throughout the methods was fun to build. I also learned how to slice lists even though I ended up not using any slice throughout the project. Event listening was another door that opened up a lot of possibilities for me.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
Right now the biggest issue I have is discipline to work on Python. I fell off a bit. I need to fix my laptop screen. After that is done I plan on pushing hard through this class. Future me will be proud and happy.
